# ðŸŽ® Doodle Jump AI

A fully playable **Doodle Jump-style game** built using `pygame`, enhanced with a **Q-learning-based AI agent**. The AI learns to play the game through reinforcement learning and can switch between AI and manual modes during gameplay.

## ðŸ§  Features

- ðŸŽ® **Manual Mode**: Control the doodle with keyboard arrows or `A/D`.
- ðŸ¤– **AI Mode**: Enable AI to play using a trained **Q-table**.
- ðŸ¦˜ Platform-to-platform jumping logic with sticky targeting.
- ðŸŒ€ Spring platforms give extra jump boost.
- ðŸ§  AI shows its decisions via a red line to the next target platform.
- ðŸ“Š Collect training data for future model improvements.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

The agent uses **Q-learning** and/or a supervised model to decide between:
- `LEFT`
- `RIGHT`
- `NONE`

The **state** consists of:
- Horizontal and vertical distance to next platform
- Velocity
- Spring presence
- Directional hint
- Stuck loop detection

The AI picks actions based on a trained Q-table (`q_table.pkl`), and can be enhanced with supervised models like `supervised_model.pkl`.
